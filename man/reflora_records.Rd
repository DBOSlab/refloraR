\title{Retrieve taxon records from REFLORA collections}
\usage{
reflora_records(herbarium = NULL,
                repatriated = TRUE,
                taxon = NULL,
                state = NULL,
                recordYear = NULL,
                indets = TRUE,
                reorder = NULL,
                path = NULL,
                updates = TRUE,
                verbose = TRUE,
                save = TRUE,
                dir = "reflora_records",
                filename = "reflora_records_search")
}
\arguments{
\item{herbarium}{A vector of specific herbarium acronyms (collection code) in
uppercase letters or leave it as \code{NULL} to summarize specimen records
for all REFLORA-hosted herbaria.}

\item{repatriated}{Logical. If \code{FALSE}, skips downloading records from
REFLORA-associated herbaria that have been repatriated. Default is \code{TRUE}.
Use \code{reflora_summary()} to check which collections are repatriated.}

\item{taxon}{A vector with the required taxon. It can be one or a vector of
multiple scientific names at family, genus or species level.}

\item{state}{A vector with the required Brazilian state(s) (full name or acronym).}

\item{recordYear}{A vector with the required record year or year range. For example,
\code{"1992"} or \code{c("1992", "2024")}}

\item{indets}{Logical, if \code{FALSE}, removes all
indeterminate specimens that are not identified to the species level
(i.e., records identified only to family or genus).}

\item{reorder}{Provide a vector with any of \code{c("herbarium", "taxa", "collector", "area", "year")}
to reorder the retrieved records based on the specified columns. By default, the
data will be redordered according to this vector, meaning the returned dataset
will be specifically reordered based on the columns \code{'herbarium'}, \code{'family'},
\code{'genus'}, \code{'specificEpithet'}, \code{'recordedBy'}, \code{'recordNumber'},
\code{'country'}, \code{'stateProvince'}, \code{'municipality'} and \code{'year'}.
You can modify the order of the vector or provide a subset of these columns to
customize the reordering of the data accordingly.}

\item{path}{Optional; a pathway to the computer's directory, where the REFLORA-downloaded
dwca folders are. If you do not provide a path, the function will download the
most updated version of the REFLORA dwca files.}

\item{updates}{Logical, if \code{FALSE}, the search will not check for the
most updated version of the REFLORA dwca files. This argument is often used if
you have defined a specific path to previously downloaded REFLORA dwca files
either manually or with function \code{reflora_download}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical, if \code{FALSE}, a message showing steps when
summarizing specimen records will not be printed in the console in full.}

\item{save}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, the search results will be saved on disk}

\item{dir}{Pathway to the computer's directory, where the table-formatted
summary will be saved. The default is to create a directory named
\code{reflora_records}.}

\item{filename}{Name of the output file to be saved. The default is to create
a file entitled \code{reflora_records_search.csv}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} containing occurrence records for the selected taxon
and criteria from the chosen REFLORA herbaria. If \code{save = TRUE}, the function
will write the results to a CSV file inside the \code{dir} directory, and also
generate or append a \code{log.txt} file that summarizes the download session
including total records and breakdowns by herbarium, family, genus, country,
and state.
}
\description{
Retrieve occurrence records for specific taxa from the
\href{https://ipt.jbrj.gov.br/reflora/}{REFLORA Virtual Herbarium},
hosted by the \href{https://www.gov.br/jbrj/pt-br}{Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden}.
This function handles automatic download, parsing, filtering, and optional
saving of the occurrence data. All returned records include direct links to
specimen images (column \code{'bibliographicCitation'}) and, when available, high-resolution
download URLs (column \code{'associatedMedia'}).
}
\details{
This function processes Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A) files from REFLORA. You
may supply a specific path to previously downloaded files using \code{path}, or let
the function handle the download automatically. Filters can be applied by taxon
name, herbarium code, state, and year. The \code{reorder} argument allows you to
customize the structure of the returned data. Use \code{verbose = TRUE} to see
status updates. Use \code{save = TRUE} to save results to disk as a CSV file in the
specified directory.
}
\note{
(1) Ensure internet access for downloading data if \code{path} is not provided.
(2) State names may be full names or standard Brazilian two-letter codes.
(3) Use \code{recordYear} as a character vector to avoid coercion issues.
(4) This function does not apply filtering for indeterminate ranks
(use \code{reflora_indets()} for that).
(5) \code{'bibliographicCitation'}: a clickable URL to the REFLORA specimen page
where the image is displayed.
(6) \code{'associatedMedia'}: one or more direct URLs to the original specimen
image(s) (typically high resolution). Multiple URLs may be separated by vertical bar.
(7) Image availability and resolution may vary by herbarium and record.
